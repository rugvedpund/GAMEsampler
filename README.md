# GAMEsampler

Based on code provided by Anze Slosar

## Testing NormalizingFlow models with GameSampler

`import flowlikelihood` should give the `flowlikelihood.likelihood()` function, which can be used anywhere

To check if `flowlikelihood.likelihood()` is working:
`python testnf.py` should return "all ok"

## Requirements for NormalizingFlow module

Using conda/pip: `pytorch luseepy corner fitsio`

Files (too large for github): 
1. `ulsa.fits` foreground map
2. `SINF:GIS` trained model
